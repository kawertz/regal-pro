## 🌟 Key Features
### 🗓️ Smart Multi-Day Scheduler
- 7-Day Sync: Automatically synchronizes showtime data for an entire week across your selected theater and all nearby "neighbor" locations.
- Optimization Strategies for Single-Day Schedules:
	- The Smart Marathon (Best Efficiency): The highest movie count that has the lowest total friction. A "3 movies / 1 hop" might beat "4 movies / 3 hops".
	- The Absolute Marathon (Max Movies): Strictly the highest count, even if it involves 4 hops and 50 miles.
	- The Single-Theater Max: The best itinerary that involves zero travel once you arrive at the first theater.
	- Priority Movie Match: Prioritizes getting #1 and #2 ranked movies into the schedule, regardless of location.
- Optimization Strategies for Mult-Day Schedules:
	- Minimize Days (Greedy Density): Packs your selected movies into the fewest number of trips possible.
	- Maximize Compactness (Efficiency Priority): Prioritizes the most efficient schedules with the shortest gaps and minimal travel, even if spread across more days.
- Optionally enforce Regal Unlimited 91 min gap between shows Rule.
- Optionally enable a Fudge Factor to allow 5 minute overlap between showtimes. This will be used only if scheduler is not otherwise able to create an itinerary.
- Download ICS to import a schedule to your calendar.
- Friction-Aware Scoring: Uses a weight system to balance movie volume against "friction" factors like driving distance, theater hops, and wait times.

### 🔎 Advanced Exploration
- Search for your theater in the **Sidebar** using Zip, Theater Name, Street/City or 4 digit Theater Code. Selecting a theater automatically loads data for all nearby locations.
- Theater Explorer:
	- Now Playing: Detailed daily views 
		- Advanced filtering for screen types (IMAX, RPX, ScreenX), ratings, and time windows, new releases etc.
		- Sort by Movie Title, Showtime or Auditorium
		- Group results by Movie, Auditorium or Full Schedule
	- Playing Nearby: Discover exclusive titles playing at neighbor theaters that aren't available at selected location.
	- Upcoming: Theater-scoped "Upcoming" schedules.
- Movie Explorer: Deep-dive into specific titles with granular format-based scheduling and a list of all scheduled dates for the week.

## 🧠 Scheduling Logic: The "Threshold of Friction"
The app engine uses a **Weighted Hybrid Algorithm**:
- **Volume First:** Each movie is assigned a base value of 250 points, ensuring the engine attempts to fit every selected title.
- **Constraints:** The engine strictly follows your Buffer, Max Gap, and Format preferences.
- **Friction Penalties:** Scores are reduced based on "friction" to ensure the most comfortable experience:
    - **Theater Hops:** -40 points per location change.
	- **Travel Distance:** -2 points per mile.
	- **Gaps: -0.1** points per minute of waiting between movies.
	
## 🛠️ Technical Notes
- **Data Source:** Fetched live from Regal API.
- **Time Zone Sync** App sync timezone based on selected theater. User can manually set UTC offset. This will be used for past shows filter and scheduling.
- **Debug Mode** Advanced Settings allows you to view raw API data. Append ?debug=true to the URL or toggle it in the sidebar to see detailed API logs and request/response payloads. This is critical for identifying why a specific theater might be missing showtimes or formatting data unexpectedly.
- **Force Refresh:** If Regal blocks the request, manually initiate data.

## 🖨️ Printing
Enable **Print View** in the sidebar to remove UI elements for a clean paper schedule.
